# CS5600 Stress Testing Programs

### Here are a small series of programs to play with in the DMTCP coordinator which are meant to stress-test the PID namespacing implementation.

**To build, run** `make`.
This will create a link from each test created in the various test folder, and place in the main folder.

You may run each test indivdiually after the code is built: <br>
- Exmaple: `./test-fork`

You may also run all tests by just using the `make run-all` build function.






Additionally, `simple-ns` contains a simple example of creating and
joining a PID namespace.
